CONVINCE SIT-AW-AIP
===================

This project allows you to use our selected **VLM**, `Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct`_, deployed **locally**, for **action classification** on **robotics** tasks. The particularity of this package is the **integrability** of the pipeline using **ROS2**. The deployment on a robotic system is straightforward, provided that the used middleware is ROS2.

:warning: **Test have only been made on LINUX, Ubuntu 22.04**
